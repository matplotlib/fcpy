Fcpy API documentation
==========================

.. currentmodule:: fcpy

The API closely follows the `fontconfig API
<http://www.freedesktop.org/software/fontconfig/fontconfig-devel/>`_.
As this time, only the basics necessary for font matching are
supported.  Notably, support for character sets and language sets are
missing.

Names have been modified to follow Python's `PEP8 style guidelines
<http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_.
